Hey guys.

So I decided that we should use github, cause its a lot
easier to set up the bitbucket. Anyways, go here www.github.com
and make an account. Then set up git, following along the with how 
they set it up. Your goina have to fork my repo. Hopefully you guys 
can figure it out. Ask me if your strugling.
